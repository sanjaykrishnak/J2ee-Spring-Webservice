The example is created ground up, but it is not working as the issue is more w.r.to 
JRE versions and Tomcat version

Inputs :- It is working fine if the object is of animal type as shown below.

http://localhost:8080/RestService-1.0/rest/animals/testJsonAnimal

Web.xml should have these configured to the container servlet.

 </init-param>
    	<init-param>
		<param-name>com.sun.jersey.api.json.POJOMappingFeature</param-name>
		<param-value>true</param-value>
</init-param>

Read it in the blogs that the below configuration of JACKSON should help JSON Object also displayed.
http://localhost:8080/RestService-1.0/rest/animals/testJson

But it is not working. Probably becuase of the version mismatches
	<init-param>
      <param-name>jersey.config.server.provider.classnames</param-name>
      <param-value>org.glassfish.jersey.jackson.JacksonFeature</param-value>
    </init-param>
    

To test :
http://localhost:8080/RestService-1.0/rest/animals

Finally changed the TOMCAT versions, and it is working fine.

MVN integration is not working in Eclipse. Go to the directory :
C:\Users\home\w4WP_workspaces\J2ee-Spring-Webservices\RestService
and press :- mvn -e package
